# dog not god: performance monitoring simplified

dog not god is a performance monitoring tool for *nix based servers.

## How does it work

There are two components to dog not god.

### Server

The server plays two roles. First, it captures performance data, second, it presents it via a web based interface.

### Installation

gem install dognotgod
dognotgod start

This will kick off a thin server on port 4567. It will also create the folder ~/.dognotgod and store the sqlite database at this location.

### Client

The client sits on the target machine - the machine to be monitored - captures performance data and sends it to the server. Note that this works on the machine acting as the server as well.

### Installation

gem install dognotgod-client

Add an entry to crontab

crontab -e
*/1 * * * * ruby /path/to/gem/client.rb >> /dev/null 2>&1

This will run the client every minute.
